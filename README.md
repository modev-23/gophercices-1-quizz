# Quiz CLI App

This is a simple command-line quiz application written in Go, as part of the **Gophercises** series. The app reads quiz questions and answers from a CSV file and prompts the user to answer them interactively.

## How It Works

- The app reads a CSV file (`quizz.csv`) where each row contains a question and its correct answer.
- The user is presented with each question and asked to provide an answer.
- At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-cli-app.git
   cd quiz-cli-app

2. Build and run the app:

  ```bash
  go build && ./path-to-folder
